# Images-to-PDF-Converter
A zip/folder to PDF converter 


A small utility Python program to convert a zip file or a folder of images into a PDF file.
(Made it because I was tired of doing it online)
Makes use of re, zipfile, PIL and wxPython


Tested on Windows OS only.

Interface is crude, due to being my first attempt of using wxPython to make it.
Please let me know if you use it and find any issues.
